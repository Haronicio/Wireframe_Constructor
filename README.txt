My first 3D programming, open WC.EXE, select a shape file in the shape folder, open for example jar.shape

Basically the project was to create a wireframe rendering engine, where we could edit each point and line

I just trying to represent some 3D object with my own 3D file format
The issues with cube and pyramid are just a bad view value that I changed for the jar
Otherwise it working
